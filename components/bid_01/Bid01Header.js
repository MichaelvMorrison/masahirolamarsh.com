        These three pieces are presented as sculptures. To keep things fair,
        this is a blind auction lasting 1 week. The is a minimum bid, and any
        value beyond is an investment in my success. All proceeds will go
        towards funding my first gallery show, and a capsule collection to be
        released NYFW in February. All pieces come with the original
        presentation, AND duplicate made to the specifications of the buyer size
        in order to maintain the integrity of the original artwork. All of these
        are to be understood as 1 of 1, with a personalized copy.
