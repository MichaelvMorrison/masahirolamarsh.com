        These three pieces are presented as sculptures. This is a blind auction
        lasting 1 week. Each piece has a minimum bid (reserve). All proceeds
        will go towards funding my first gallery show, and a capsule collection
        to be released in February for NYFW. All pieces come with the original
        presentation, AND duplicate made to the specifications of the
        buyer&apos;s size in order to maintain the integrity of the original
        artwork. All of these are to be understood as 1 of 1, along with a
        personalized copy.
