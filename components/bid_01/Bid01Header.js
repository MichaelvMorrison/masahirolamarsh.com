        These three pieces are presented as sculptures. This is a blind auction
        lasting 1 week. Each piece has a minimum bid (reserve), and any bid
        value beyond that is an investment in my success. All proceeds will go
        towards funding my first gallery show, and a capsule collection to be
        released in February for New York Fashion Week. All pieces come with the
        original presentation, AND duplicate made to the specifications of the
        buyer's size in order to maintain the integrity of the original artwork.
        All of these are to be understood as 1 of 1, along with a personalized
        copy.
